# Breast_Cancer_ML_Project
To classify whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using machine learning techniques applied to a labeled dataset containing clinical data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Techniques Used** ------->
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Selection

Model Building:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest

Decision Tree

Model Evaluation:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

Model Comparison
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Target Variable: diagnosis (M = Malignant, B = Benign)

Feature Examples:

radius_mean

texture_mean

perimeter_mean

area_mean

smoothness_mean

etc.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **How to Run the Project
Clone this repository or download the project folder.

Open the Jupyter notebook Breast_Cancer_ML_Project.ipynb.

Ensure the required libraries are installed:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run the cells in order.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Key Insights
Correlation between certain features and the diagnosis label is clearly visible.

Some models perform significantly better with balanced data and scaling.

Feature selection greatly impacts model performance and accuracy.
